There is a large number of articles, books, blogs, and so on, that discuss microservices to varying depths. I have selected just a few here. These are ones that I enjoyed reading!

Daya, S. et al. (2015). “Microservices from Theory to Practice.” IBM Redbook (SG24-8275-00).
https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/sg248275.html

Ch. 1, sections 1.1,1.3, 1.4.

Summary: The first chapter of this Redbook is entitled “Motivation for microservices”, and covers the basics of what they are, the benefits and the pitfalls of using them, and shows how microservices differ from SOA – a topic that is not covered in this course, but which is good background information. You can download the entire Redbook for free, and this is a reference that we shall use throughout the course.

Jones, T (2017). “So You’re Thinking of Decomposing Your Monolith into Microservices.”
https://blog.codeship.com/so-youre-thinking-of-decomposing-your-monolith-into-microservices/#disqus_thread

Summary: A great little article that sums up what microservices are, and some of the problems involved with decomposing monoliths. Very well written!

Richardson, C (2014). “Microservices: Decomposing Applications for Deployability and Scalability.”
https://www.infoq.com/articles/microservices-intro

Summary: This article goes into depth on the pros and cons of decomposition. The numerous diagrams are very helpful to understanding the big picture.
